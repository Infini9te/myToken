# Create a Token
Create a Token is a small project built using Solidity for blockchain development. It provides a basic implementation of a token contract, allowing users to create and manage their own tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
## Description
By following this project, users can gain hands-on experience in creating their own custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The code provides a clear and concise implementation of a token contract, complete with functionalities such as token issuance, transfers, and balances. This project serves as an educational resource for those looking to understand the fundamental concepts of token creation and lays the groundwork for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform.
## Getting Started
### Installing
To get started with the Create a Token project in the Remix Ethereum IDE, follow these steps:

*Open the Remix Ethereum IDE in your web browser by visiting the official Remix website: https://remix.ethereum.org.
*Create a new file and name it "Token.sol".
*Copy and paste the Solidity code from the "Token.sol" file in the project repository into the Remix editor.

### Executing program
*Compile the contract by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the right-hand side of the IDE and then clicking the "Compile Token.sol" button.
*Once the contract is successfully compiled, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
*Select the appropriate Ethereum network (e.g., "JavaScript VM" for a local test environment or "Injected Web3" for using an external provider like Metamask).
*Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the token contract to the selected network.

## Help
// mint function
    function mint(address _address,uint _value)public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;

    }

    // burn function
    function burn(address _address,uint _value)public {
        if(balances[_address] >=_value){
         totalSupply -= _value;
         balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
